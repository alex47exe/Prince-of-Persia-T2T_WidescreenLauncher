### Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones ~ Widescreen Launcher

Old launcher based on the *hex editing method* at [http://www.wsgf.org](http://www.wsgf.org/dr/prince-persia-two-thrones) and *RELOADED's crack*; you should use the new [Widescreen Launcher v2](https://github.com/alex47exe/Prince-of-Persia-T2T_WidescreenLauncher_v2/releases)!

------

***Features:***

- includes *[7za.exe](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)* & *[RunFirst.exe](https://www.activeplus.com/products/runfirst)*, which are unpacked at first launch in *C:\Program Data\SalFisher47*

- automatically detects resolution and aspect ratio, then unpacks needed *POP3.exe* from *WidescreenLauncher\PoP3_aspect_ratio.7z*
- *RELOADED's crack* was used as a base for hex editing the required *POP3.exe* files for various aspect ratios, as explained at [http://www.wsgf.org](http://www.wsgf.org/dr/prince-persia-two-thrones)
- when *POP3.exe* runs the first time, *Hardware.ini* gets reset to some default values, causing some graphical issues when fog is enabled; to avoid this, launcher uses *Blank.exe* instead of *POP3.exe* at first run, then it automatically corrects those values and launches the game
- game will run on the first cpu core, to avoid extreme gameplay speed on multi-core cpus
